## 1. Problem Statement & Objective

### Goals
- Explore and analyze e-commerce transaction data to identify patterns and trends
- Understand customer behavior and transaction statuses across different cities and merchants

### Problems Addressed
- Lack of clarity in transaction statuses across cities and merchants
- Impact on business decisions regarding resource allocation and customer targeting

### Challenges
- Inconsistent transaction statuses
- Missing or duplicate data
- Complex relationships between merchants, cities, and transaction statuses

### Opportunity
- Identify trends in transaction statuses (e.g., cities or merchants with more burned transactions)
- Optimize business operations, enhance customer experience, and improve transaction success rates

### Importance
- Crucial for business growth, customer retention, and operational efficiency
- Significant impact on decision-making, particularly in optimizing marketing strategies and improving transaction success rates

## 2. Methodology

### Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize transaction distributions across cities and merchants
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Remove duplicates
   - Check for outliers
3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Aggregate transaction data for analysis

### Challenges Overcome
- Handled missing values in the transaction department
- Identified and addressed outliers during preprocessing
- Removed unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset

## 3. Insights/Findings

### Key Findings
- Transaction status distribution (burned, subscribed) varies significantly across cities
- Some merchants have disproportionately high numbers of burned transactions
- Certain cities consistently have higher rates of successful transactions

### Business Context
- Focus on improving merchant and city-specific operations
- Provide targeted support for merchants with high failure rates
- Consider expanding business efforts in high-performing regions
## Power BI Dashboard for E-Commerce Segmentation Project

### Overview
In addition to data analysis and modeling, a **Power BI** dashboard was created to provide an interactive and visual representation of the e-commerce segmentation data. The dashboard helps stakeholders quickly gain insights and make data-driven decisions.

### Features of the Power BI Dashboard:
- **Customer Segmentation Overview**: Visual breakdown of customers into various segments based on purchasing behavior and demographic data.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Metrics such as total revenue, average order value, customer lifetime value, and customer acquisition costs are highlighted for each segment.
- **Revenue and Order Trends**: Line and bar charts showcasing revenue and order trends over time, segmented by customer type.
- **Top Products and Categories**: A detailed analysis of the top-selling products and categories, helping identify key drivers of revenue.
- **Geographical Insights**: Map visualizations to track sales performance across different regions, giving a clear geographical distribution of customers.
- **Segment-Specific Visualizations**: Specific dashboards tailored to each customer segment (e.g., high-value customers, one-time buyers), allowing for deep dives into segment behavior.

### Benefits
- Provides an intuitive, high-level overview of the customer base and their purchasing habits.
- Allows quick identification of trends, outliers, and areas for improvement.
- Facilitates data-driven decision-making for marketing strategies, product optimization, and customer retention efforts.
